Welcome to my professional page! I'm Dr. John Holash, a dedicated educator and researcher based in Calgary, Alberta, specializing in muscle physiology and the transformative power of exercise on the human body. With a fervent passion for both the scientific understanding and practical application of exercise physiology, I've spent years unraveling the intricate mechanisms through which physical activity influences our health and well-being.

My academic journey has been a blend of research and dynamic teaching, aimed at instilling a deep-seated curiosity about human physiology among my students. At the core of my teaching philosophy lies the belief in challenging students not just academically but also to think critically about how exercise can fundamentally enhance and extend our lives.

Outside the classroom, you'll find me embracing the great outdoors, whether it's skiing down the pristine slopes of the Rockies, cycling through Alberta's breathtaking landscapes, or sailing the serene waters of Canada's vast lakes. These activities are not just hobbies but integral parts of my research and personal philosophy on health and fitness.
