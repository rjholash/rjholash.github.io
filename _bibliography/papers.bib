@article{Tanaka2012,
  abstract = {Exergames or active video games are video games with interfaces that require active involvement and the exertion of physical force by participants. These exergames are designed to track body motion and provide both fun and exercise for game players. Numerous video game console companies have designed exergaming interfaces that are becoming very popular. This paper examines the nature of the interfaces and explores the possibility of using these interfaces for rehabilitation programs and research. While many systems exist, this paper will focus on three major players: Sony PlayStation Move, Nintendo Wii, and Microsoft Xbox 360 Kinect. Comparisons include the technical specifications, the motion sensed by each interface, and the motion required in each therapeutic activity type. Discussion addresses the research implications of using these tools.},

ABSTRACT = {We are currently witnessing an unprecedented era of digital transformation in sports, driven by the revolutions in Artificial Intelligence (AI), Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), and Data Visualization (DV). These technologies hold the promise of redefining sports performance analysis, automating data collection, creating immersive training environments, and enhancing decision-making processes. Traditionally, performance analysis in sports relied on manual data collection, subjective observations, and standard statistical models. These methods, while effective, had limitations in terms of time and subjectivity. However, recent advances in technology have ushered in a new era of objective and real-time performance analysis. AI has revolutionized sports analysis by streamlining data collection, processing vast datasets, and automating information synthesis. VR introduces highly realistic training environments, allowing athletes to train and refine their skills in controlled settings. AR overlays digital information onto the real sports environment, providing real-time feedback and facilitating tactical planning. DV techniques convert complex data into visual representations, improving the understanding of performance metrics. In this paper, we explore the potential of these emerging technologies to transform sports performance analysis, offering valuable resources to coaches and athletes. We aim to enhance athletes&rsquo; performance, optimize training strategies, and inform decision-making processes. Additionally, we identify challenges and propose solutions for integrating these technologies into current sports analysis practices. This narrative review provides a comprehensive analysis of the historical context and evolution of performance analysis in sports science, highlighting current methods&rsquo; merits and limitations. It delves into the transformative potential of AI, VR, AR, and DV, offering insights into how these tools can be integrated into a theoretical model.},
